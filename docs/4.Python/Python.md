### What is MicroPython?

Python is a text-based language, which is widely used in education and is also used by professional programmers in fields such as data science and machine learning. 

Micro: bit can be programmed in Python, which is a microcontroller, and the hardware differences prevent micro: bit from fully supporting Python. The MicroPython is dedicated to micro：bit，which is an efficient implementation of the Python3 programming language. It contains a small portion of the Python standard library and is optimized to run on micro: bit microcontrollers.

The version of Python used by BBC micro: bit is called MicroPython. The MicroPython is perfect for those who want to learn more about programming, which helps you program with a series of code snippets, a variety of pre-made graphics and music.

### How Mu Import Library to Micro:bit

<span style="color: rgb(255, 76, 65);">**Before importing libraries, we need to upload a .py code (empty code is also ok) to the micro:bit board. Here we take an empty code as an example.**</span>

Connect the board to computer via USB cable. Open the Mu and click “Flash” to upload the .py code (empty code) to the board.

![Img](./media/microbit.png)

In this tutorial, "keyes_mecanum_Car_V2.py" library file are used. Therefore, import the "keyes_mecanum_Car_V2.py" library file into the micro:bit. This file contains the control method of the Micro:bit 4WD Mecanum Robot Car V2.0.

The default directory for Mu to save files is “mu_code”in the root directory of the user’s directory. 

References link: [https://codewith.mu/en/tutorials/1.0/files](https://codewith.mu/en/tutorials/1.0/files)

**the Methods of finding the "mu_code" folder:**

**Method One:**

For example, on the windows system, suppose your system is installed on the C driver of the computer, and the user name is "**Administrator**", then the path of the "**mu_code**" directory is "**C:\Users\Administrator\mu_ code**". On Linux systems, the path of the "**mu_code**" directory is "**~/home/mu_code**".

Open the “**mu_code**”folder.

![](./media/Mu-13.png)

**Method Two:**

Search for the “mu_code” folder on the Disk(C:).

![Img](./media/Mu-14.png)

![Img](./media/Mu-15.png)

Open “mu_code”.

![Img](./media/Mu-16.png)

The path of the data folder where the “keyes_mecanum_Car.py”library file we provide are located is as follows:

![Img](./media/Mu-17.png)

Copy“keyes_mecanum_Car.py”library file to the folder“mu_code”。When the copy is done, as shown below:

![](./media/Mu-18.png)

First open the Mu software and connect the micro:bit to your computer then click the "Files" button, and drag the "keyes_mecanum_Car.py" library file to the micro:bit.

### Project 4：Programmable Buttons

![](./media/microbit5.png)

1\.  **Description**

![](./media/button.png)

Buttons can be used to control circuits. In an integrated circuit with a push button, the circuit is connected when pressing the button and but after release, it will break again. 

Both ends of the button like two mountains. There is a river in between. 
The internal metal piece connect the two sides to let the current pass, just like building a bridge to connect two mountains.

The internal structure of the button is shown as follows: before pressing the button, 1 ,2 , 3 and 4 are turned on. However, 1, 3 or 1, 4 or 2, 3 or 2 and 4 are disconnected, which is only enabled when the button is pressed. ![](./media/button1.png)

Micro: Bit main board boasts three push buttons, two are programmable buttons(marked with A and B), and the one on the other side is a reset button. By pressing the two programmable buttons can input three different signals. We can press button A or B alone or press them together and the LED dot matrix shows A,B and AB respectively. Let’s get started.

### Project 6：Geomagnetic Sensor

![](./media/microbit8.png)

1\.  **Description**

This project mainly introduces the use of the micro:bit’s geomagnetic sensor. In addition to detecting the strength of the magnetic field, it can also be used to determine the direction, which is an important part of the heading and attitude reference system (AHRS) as well.

It uses FreescaleMAG3110 three-axis magnetometer. Its I2C interface communicates with the outside, and the range is ±1000µT, the maximum data update rate is 80Hz. Combined with an accelerometer, it can calculate the position. Additionally, it is applied to magnetic detection and compass blocks.

Then we could read the value detected by it to determine the location. We need to calibrate the micro:bit board when the magnetic sensor works. The correct calibration method is to rotate the micro:bit board. 

In addition, the objects nearby may affect the accuracy of readings and calibration.

3\.  **Test Code**

Enter Mu software and open the file“Touch-sensitive Logo\.py”to import code.You can also input code in the edit window yourself.

(**Note: All English words and symbols must be written in English**.)

![](./media/code15.png)

```python
from microbit import *
time = 0
start = 0
running = False

while True:

    if button_a.was_pressed():
        running = True
        start = running_time()
    if button_b.was_pressed():
        if running:
            time += running_time() - start
        running = False
    if pin_logo.is_touched():
        if not running:
            display.scroll(int(time/1000))

    if running:
        display.show(Image.HEART)
        sleep(300)
        display.show(Image.HEART_SMALL)
        sleep(300)
    else:
        display.show(Image.ASLEEP)
```

**How Micro:bit works?**

A\. The runtime is recorded in milliseconds(ms) .

B\. When you press button A, a variable named start will be set to the current running time.

C\. When you press button B, the start time will be subtracted from the new running time to calculate the passed time since you started the stopwatch. This difference is added to the total time, which is stored in a variable named time.

D\. If you press the golden logo, the program will display the total elapsed time on the LED display. It converts time from milliseconds (thousandths of a second) to seconds by dividing by 1000. It uses the integer division operator to give an integer (integer) result.

E\. The program is also controlled by a Boolean variable named running. Boolean variable only has two values: true or false. If "running" is "true", it means that the stopwatch has started. If "running" is false, it means that the stopwatch has not started or has stopped.

F\. If "running" is true, the beating heart pattern will be displayed on the LED dot matrix screen.

G\. (7) If the stopwatch has stopped and the "running" is false, when you press the golden logo, it will only display the time.

H\. If the stopwatch has been started and"running" is true, it only need to ensure that the time variable will change when button B is pressed, and the code can also prevent false readings.

Click“Check”to examine errors in the code. The program proves wrong if underlines and cursors are shown.

![Img](./media/Code-Explanation12.png)

#### Bluetooth Wireless Communication

The micro:bit owns a low-consumption Bluetooth module to communicate but with 16k RAM. However, BLE heap stack occupies 12K RAM, thereby there is no enough space to run microPython.

At present, microPython doesn’t support the Bluetooth service.

[https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ble.html](https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ble.html)

The former projects are the introduction of sensors and modules. The further lessons are challenging for new starters.

(**Note: In order to refrain the micro:bit board from being burned, disconnect the micro USB cable from it and turn off the power on the micro:bit motor driver base plate before installing it on the car expansion board and dial the POWER switch to the OFF end. Likewise, before removing the the main board from the car expansion board, disconnect the micro USB cable from it and turn off the power on the micro:bit motor driver base plate.**)

### Project 15：Servo

![](./media/servo.png)

1\.  **Description**

The DIY smart cars usually contain the function of automatic obstacle avoidance. In the DIY process, we need a servo to control the ultrasonic module to rotate left and right, and then detect the distance between the car and the obstacle, so as to control the car to avoid the obstacle. 

If other microcontrollers are used to control the rotation of the servo, we need to set a certain frequency and width of pulse to control the servo angle. But if the micro:bit main board is used to control the servo angle, we only need to set the control angle in the development environment where the corresponding pulse will be automatically set to control the servo rotation. In this project, you will learn how to control the servo to rotate back and forth between 0° and 90°. 

Servo motor is a position control rotary actuator, which mainly consists of housing, circuit board, core-less motor, gear and position sensor. Its working principle is that the servo receives the signal sent by MCU or receiver, and produces a reference signal with a period of 20ms and width of 1.5ms, then compares the acquired DC bias voltage to the voltage of the potentiometer and obtains the voltage difference output.

For the servo used in this project, the brown wire is the ground, the red one is the positive wire, and the orange one is the signal wire.

![](./media/servo1.png)

2\.  **Information of the Servo**

The rotation angle of servo motor is controlled by regulating the duty cycle of PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) signal. The standard cycle of PWM signal is 20ms (50Hz). Theoretically, the width is distributed between 1ms-2ms, but in fact, it's between 0.5ms-2.5ms. The width corresponds to the rotation angle from 0° to 180°. But note that for different brand motor, the same signal may have different rotation angle. 

![](./media/servo2.png)

After measurement, the pulse range of the servo is 0.65ms~2.5ms. For a 180 degree servo, the corresponding control relationship is as follow:


|Time on High Level|Angle of the Servo|Reference Signal Cycle Time（20ms）|
|-|-|-|
|0.65ms|0 degree|0.65ms high level+19.35ms low level|
|1.5ms|90 degrees|1.5ms high level+18.5ms low level|
|2.5ms|180degrees|2.5ms high level+17.5ms low level|


3\.  **Parameters**

- Stopping torque: 1.3 ± 0.01kg · cm (DC 4.8V) ,1.5 ± 0.1kg · cm (DC 6V)

- Stop current: ≦ 850mA (DC 4.8V) ≦ 1000mA (DC 6V)

- Standby current: 3 ± 1mA (DC 4.8V), 4 ± 1mA (DC 6V)

- Weight: 9±1g (without servo horn)

### Project 17：Line Tracking Sensor

#### Project 17.1：Detect Line Tracking Sensor

![](./media/Line-Tracking.png)

1\. **Description**

The motor driver board of the Keyestudio 4WD Mecanum Robot Car comes with a 3-channel line tracking sensor, which adopts TCRT5000 IR tubes and 3 potentiometers.

The TCRT5000 IR tube contains an IR emitting tube and an IR receiving tube. When the infrared signals of the emitting tube is received by the receiving tube through reflection, the resistance of the receiving tube will change, which is generally reflected in the voltage change on the circuit.  

The resistance varies depending on the intensity of the infrared signals received by the receiving tube, which is often in the color of the reflecting surface and the distance of the reflecting surface receiving tube.  At the time of detection, black is high level active and white is low level active. 

2\.  **Working Principle**

When the car runs above a white road, the IR emitting tube installed under the car emits infrared signals to detect the road and the receiving tube will receive signals sending back. Then the output end outputs low level(0); when it detects black lines, it outputs high level(1).

The 3-channel tracking sensor integrated port on the 4WD Mecanum Robot Car is connected to the collection port of G ,5V ,P10, P4 and P3 on the micro:bit expansion board, which is controlled by the P10, P4 and P3 of the micro:bit. The left TCRT5000 infrared pair tube on the sensor is controlled by P3, the middle one is by P4 and the right one is by P10. 

After putting a white paper on the bottom of the 4WD Mecanum Robot Car, we will rotate the potentiometers on the 3-way tracking sensor. When the indicator light on the sensor module is on, pick up the car to make the two wheels on the 4WD Mecanum Robot Car separate. The height of the white paper is about 1.5cm, when the indicator light on the sensor module is off, and then the sensitivity is adjusted.

**Note that since the 5*5 dot matrix uses the P3P4P6P7P10, we must turn off the dot matrix function when using the line tracking sensor. **

3\.  **Preparation**

- Insert micro:bit board into the slot of keyestudio 4WD Mecanum Robot CarV2.0

- Place batteries into battery holder

- Dial power switch to ON end

- Connect micro:bit to computer via an USB cable

- Open the offline version of Mu.

### Project 18：Ultrasonic Sensor

#### Project 18.1：Ultrasonic Ranging

1\. **Description**

![](./media/Ultrasonic.jpg)

The ultrasonic sensor uses sonar to determine distance to an object like bats do. It offers excellent non-contact range detection with high accuracy and stable readings in an easy-to-use package. It comes complete with ultrasonic transmitter and receiver modules.

The ultrasonic sensor is being used in a wide range of electronics projects for creating obstacle detection and distance measuring application as well as various other applications. 

![](./media/Ultrasonic1.png)

The ultrasonic module will emit the ultrasonic waves after trigger signals. When the ultrasonic waves encounter the object and are reflected back, the module outputs an echo signal, so it can determine the distance of object from the time difference between trigger signal (TRIG)and echo signal(ECHO). 

As the picture shows, it is like two eyes. One is transmitting end, the other is receiving end.

According to the above wiring diagram, the integrated port of the ultrasonic sensor module is connected to the 5V G P15 P16 port on the micro:bit motor driver base plate. The Trig (T) pin is controlled by P15 of the micro:bit and the pin of Echo (E) the P16.

![](./media/Ultrasonic2.jpg)

2\. **Working Principle**

![](./media/Ultrasonic3.png)

(1)Pull down TRIG then trigger high level signals with least 10us;

(2)After triggering, the module will automatically send eight 40KHz ultrasonic pulses and detect whether there is a signal return;

(3)If there is a signal return, when ECHO (E) outputs a high level, then the duration of the high level is the time from transmission to reception of the ultrasonic waves. Then test distance = high level duration \*340m/s\*0.5. 

3\.  **Parameters**

- Working voltage: 3-5.5V (DC)

- Working current: 15mA

- Working frequency: 40khz

- Maximum detection distance: about 3m

- Minimum detection distance: 2-3cm

- Precision: up to 0.2cm

- Sensing angle: less than 15 degrees

- Input trigger pulse: 10us TTL level

- Output echo signal: output TTL level signal (high), proportional t  range

4\.  **Preparation**

- Insert micro:bit board into the slot of keyestudio 4WD Mecanum Robot CarV2.0

- Place batteries into battery holder

- Dial power switch to ON end

- Connect micro:bit to the computer via an USB cable
